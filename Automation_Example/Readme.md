# Automation examples
**Traffic light example**

In this first practice we will make a first small contact to remember the knowledge given above. To do this, we will study the simple behavior of a simple physical problem in which counters and timers are used; so that we become familiar with the elements of the S7-300 for future practices.


**Weighing example**

One of the objectives of this practice is to become familiar with the use of function blocks and functions parametrized The passing of parameters is the mechanism of information passing between the block invoking and invoked, similar to the mechanism of passage by value of arguments to a function in a high level language. The other objective is to program a real control that has as input an transduced analog signal. In the example system it is necessary to read a scale with input ranges to the PLC [0V-0Kg, 10V-50Kg]. For this, you will have to program a simple control of a part of a transport system and filling boxes
